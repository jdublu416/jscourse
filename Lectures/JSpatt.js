//JavaScript Patterns

    //a reusable solution that can be applied to occurring problems in software design (js applications)
    //can also be thought of as programming templates (situations can vary significantly)
    // examples include the constructor pattern, the prototype pattern, the module pattern, the mvc pattern

        //Module and Revealing modular pattern -- used for overall structure allowing us to break up code into modules having private variable and functions as well as public

        //Singleton -- variation of above but can only create one instance of object

        //Factory -- used to create many many objects

        //Observer -- allows us to subscribe and unsubscribe to events

        //Mediator --central mediator that has colleagues that stem off of it

        //State -- allows us to have a state that we can change the state therefore changing content on the UI
